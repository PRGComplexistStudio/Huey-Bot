# Huey Bot
## Enter the bot

This is a template for a Discord bot that speaks to your Philips Hue light bulbs.  You'll need to do a little set up first like creating [a new application on Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), and then making a new user for the application, and grabbing the token for that new user, but then you should be good to go.  You should be able to discern where to plug in everything after exploring the files & file structure, but if you can't, just shout.  When you're done shouting, send me a message and I'll help.

Here is [the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=024upsEuHaU&t=1s) I'm basing all of this on.  I'm copying a good amount of what he's doing up until the commands and Hue functionality.  It's a very good tutorial.

Also you can grab all of the packages by typing **npm install** in your command line/terminal.

**Enjoy**
